# MLPC 2024 - Team Pocket

## Installation

Our project uses `conda`/`miniconda` to manage dependencies.

```bash
conda -f environment.yml new
conda activate mlpc-2024
```

## Jupyter Lab

```
conda activate mlpc-2024
jupyter lab
```

Of course, you can also use editor integrations for jupyter instead of `jupyter lab`.
