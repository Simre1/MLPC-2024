# MLPC 2024 - Team Pocket

## Installation

Our project uses `conda`/`miniconda` to manage dependencies.

**Clone the project with https or ssh (choose https if you are not sure):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Simre1/MLPC-2024.git
```

or 

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Simre1/MLPC-2024.git
```

**Install the conda environment:**

Go into the `MLPC-2024` directory and set up the conda environment.

```bash
conda -f environment.yml new
conda activate mlpc-2024
```

**Run Jupyter Lab**

Activate the environment and start Jupyter Lab while you are in the `MLPC-2024` directory.

```bash
conda activate mlpc-2024
jupyter lab
```

Of course, you can also use editor integrations for jupyter instead of `jupyter lab`.
